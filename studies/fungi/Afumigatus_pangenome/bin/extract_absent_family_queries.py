"""Per-strain query extraction for the genome-level tblastn rescue pass
(component 1b), REDESIGNED 2026-09-15 from a single-combined-genome-DB
search to a per-strain search -- see run_rescue_pass_per_strain.sh's header
comment for the full rationale (the combined-DB design's `-max_target_seqs`
had to be shared across all 295 strains per query, which silently truncated
rescue candidates for any family present in more than a handful of
strains; verified against the completed run's own output: 89.4% of hit
queries landed exactly at the old cap).

For each strain, writes a FASTA of only the tier-1 family representative
sequences currently ABSENT in that strain (per `--matrix`) -- rescue only
ever needs to check cells the protein-level clustering already called
absent, so this also cuts total tblastn work relative to searching the
full family set against every strain (this study's real data: roughly
80% of (family, strain) cells are ABSENT, so ~20% less total query x
db-size work than searching everything against everything, on top of the
correctness fix).

Usage:
  extract_absent_family_queries.py --matrix presence_matrix.tsv \\
      --rep_fasta tier1_rep_seq.fasta --out_dir per_strain_queries/
  # writes per_strain_queries/<Short>.absent.fa for every strain with at
  # least one absent family, plus per_strain_queries/manifest.tsv
  # (Short<TAB>n_absent_families<TAB>query_fasta_path)
