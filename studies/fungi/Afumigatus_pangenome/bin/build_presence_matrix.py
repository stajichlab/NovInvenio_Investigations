"""Build the family x strain presence matrix from a tier-1 cluster TSV --
notes/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-pangenome-cluster-profile-design.md,
component 2. This is the producer of the `presence_matrix.tsv` that
rescue_pass.py, frequency_bins.py, cooccurrence.py and hac_screen.py all
consume.

Usage:
  build_presence_matrix.py --cluster_tsv tier1_cluster.tsv --config config.csv \\
      --output presence_matrix.tsv

## ID conventions established here (four other scripts depend on them)

1. **Protein IDs must be Short-prefixed BEFORE clustering.** The cluster TSV
   carries only sequence IDs, so the only way to recover which strain a family
   member came from is to put the strain there. Build the clustering input
   FASTA with headers of the form::

       ><Short>|<original_protein_id>

   where `<Short>` is the `Short` column from `config.csv` (the same key every
   other script uses) and `|` is the separator (`--id_sep` to override).
   NovInvenio has no ready-made prefixer for this -- `bin/extract_candidates.py`
   there emits bare protein IDs -- so the concatenation step is a one-liner per
   strain, e.g.::

       for each IN row of config.csv:
           awk -v s="$Short" '/^>/{sub(/^>/,">"s"|")}1' \\
               data_dir/pep_collapsed/$Protein >> all_ingroup.fa

   Run NovInvenio's `bin/collapse_isoforms.py` first (see rescue_pass.py's
   docstring) so per-strain copy counts count genes, not transcripts.
   Then cluster: `cluster_backend.py mmseqs-tier1 --fasta all_ingroup.fa
   --out_prefix tier1` (or `diamond-tier1`), which writes `tier1_cluster.tsv`.

2. **Family ID = the tier-1 cluster representative ID, as-is.** No rewriting,
   no renumbering -- rescue_pass.py's `--matrix` family column, cooccurrence.py's
   family column and hac_screen.py's `--hac_family_id`/`--haca_family_id` all
   assume the family ID is literally the representative sequence ID that mmseqs
   or diamond reported (Short prefix included).

3. **Columns = `config.csv`'s IN and OUT strains by default** (`--groups IN,OUT`).
   cooccurrence.py's gain/loss polarization reads outgroup columns out of this
   same matrix -- an ingroup-only matrix (`--groups IN`) silently makes every
   family's polarization "ambiguous" (cooccurrence.py now warns loudly when it
   detects this rather than mis-reporting a confident gain/loss). Pass
   `--groups IN` only for a study that genuinely has no outgroup.

4. **`copy_number` = how many of that strain's proteins fall in that family.**
   Persisted alongside the matrix in `<output>.copy_number.tsv` (see
   lib/pangenome_matrix.py); hac_screen.py reports it.

A member whose prefix is not a known strain is counted and reported; if EVERY
member is unrecognized the run hard-errors (the same "your IDs are wrong" guard
rescue_pass.py uses), because that means the FASTA was not Short-prefixed.
